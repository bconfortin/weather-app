# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will
remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right
into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will
point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you
shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t
customize it when you are ready for it.

### Process

As a part of our interview process, we ask each candidate to complete a short programming exercise with the following
instructions:

Using React and typescript, connect to a public weather and geocoding REST APIs. Display the 7 day forecast for a
specified address on an HTML page.

US Census Geocoding service for converting addresses into latitude and
longitude: https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/Geocoding_Services_API.pdf

US National Weather Service API: https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api

Use whatever tools you like. We're big fans of VSCode, but you're welcome to use whatever environment you're proficient
with. This is your opportunity to show off. Think about the technical design of the solution, and how the different
components fit together. How will you test your application? We'll be walking through your solution together during your
interview, so make sure it's running locally and you can share your screen via Teams. Once the candidate has completed
the audition, please make the code available via either a shared repository or an archive attached to an email. We'll
review your solution then schedule a follow-up session to review your running solution and make a small change together
via screenshare.

We just only need you to publish it in a GitHub link, and then we will have the last call
